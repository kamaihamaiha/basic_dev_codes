## 15.1 friend class

- A class is a friend of another class
- The friend class can access all members even private members
- A friend class can be public, protected and private

[Code Example](../../suet/chapter15/friend.cpp)


### friend member functions

缩小访问范围，只有类 Supplier 中的 provide 函数可以访问我的 members

- A single member function of a class is a friend
- Different from friend functions
- But very similar to a normal friend function

```c++
class Sinper {
private:
    int bullets;
   
public:
    Sinper(int bulltes = 0): bullets(bullets) {}
    friend bool Supplier::provide(Sniper &sniper);
};
```
